            <p>In the realm of Formula 1, few names evoke as much passion and expectation as Ferrari. It's a team steeped in history, glory, 
                and a relentless pursuit of excellence. When Sebastian Vettel, a four-time World Champion,
                joined the Scuderia Ferrari in 2015, it seemed like a match made in racing heaven. However, 
                what followed was a journey marked by moments of brilliance intertwined with frustration and unfulfilled dreams.
               
               Vettel's arrival at Ferrari was greeted with immense optimism. After all, here was a driver who had conquered the Formula 1 
               world with Red Bull Racing, displaying a blend of raw speed, tactical acumen, and unwavering determination. 
               Paired with the iconic red cars of Ferrari, it was a partnership that promised to reignite the team's championship ambitions.
               
               The early years seemed promising. Vettel quickly endeared himself to the Tifosi, Ferrari's passionate fan base, with 
               victories in his debut season, including an emotional win at the historic home race in Monza. 
               The Scuderia appeared to be on an upward trajectory, challenging Mercedes' dominance and revitalizing the championship battle.</p>

            <p>
                <li>However, as the seasons progressed, cracks began to appear in the Ferrari-Vettel alliance. 
                Technical setbacks, strategic errors, and fierce competition eroded their championship hopes. 
                Despite flashes of brilliance, 
                including memorable wins in Singapore, Hungary, and Monaco, elusive consistency and the formidable might of
                Mercedes often left them trailing in the title race.</li>
                
                <li>The nadir came in 2019, a season marred by missed opportunities and internal struggles. Ferrari's car lacked</li>
                the pace to challenge Mercedes consistently, while Vettel faced criticism for high-profile mistakes under pressure. 
                Controversies, such as team orders and on-track collisions, further tarnished their campaign, casting doubt on 
                the viability of their partnership.
                
                Amidst mounting pressure, the announcement of Vettel's departure from Ferrari at the end of the 2020 season signaled 
                the end of an era. Despite mutual respect and admiration, both parties acknowledged the need for a fresh start. 
                Vettel's tenure with Ferrari, though falling short of the coveted championship glory, was not without its highlights 
                and unforgettable moments.</p>
